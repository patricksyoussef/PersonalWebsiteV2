In this series, I plan to build intuition for machine learning topics leading up to modern neural networks, below is the plan for the series and links to completed posts:

- [Gradient Descent](/blog/neural-net-gradient-descent/)
- Logistic Regression for Classification
- Two Layer Neural Network
- Gradients Over Many Layers
- Modern Deep Learning Frameworks
