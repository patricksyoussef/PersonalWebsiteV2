I've been getting some questions on how I created the sigmoid figure from my [logistic regression post](/blog/logistic-regression-intro/), in particular how I integrated LaTeX into matplotlib. It's quite easy so I thought I'd share some tips and break down how I made that plot.

# Prerequisites

## Installing LaTeX

You'll need to make sure that you have LaTeX intstalled on your computer. Many of us are used to using Overleaf so if you haven't installed LaTeX locally I would [start here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

## Enabling LaTeX

Outside of your typical matplotlib imports you need to enable the rcParam `text.usetex`

```python highlight=3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True  # [!code highlight]
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# Useful for running matplotlib on high-dpi displays
%config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'
```

As an example, let's build up the prior figure.

# Creating Plot

## Evaluating Sigmoid

Not that it's relevant to LaTeX but the below was used to compute points for plotting.

```python
X = np.linspace(-10, 10, int(1e3))
Y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-X)) # Sigmoid function evaluated on X
```

And for generating the plot itself we'll do go ahead and proceed in two steps.

## Primary Plot Axes

As you can see, to indicate you want to render a LaTeX equation all you need to do is pass a raw string with `$$` around the equation in the LaTeX syntax.

```python
plt.plot(X, Y, c='blue')
plt.title("Sigmoid Function",fontsize=15)
plt.xlabel(r"$x$", fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel(r'$\sigma(x)$', fontsize=15)
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This gives you the same plot you saw before without the written equation.

## Equation Box

The equation box is a matplotlib text box with some additional specifiers for styling.

```python
plt.text(2, 0.18, r'$\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$', fontsize=22,
         bbox=dict(boxstyle="round", ec=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), fc=(1., 1, 1)))
```

Let's go through the arguments to understand what's going on here. [Details here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html).

- `2, 0.18` are the position arguments
- `r$...$` is the input text, in this case an equation
- `fontsize` is self-explanatory
- `bbox` is the style specifier.
  - `boxstyle` determines the bounding box style
  - `ec` is a tuple of normalized RGB values for the border color
  - `fc` is the same as `ec` except for fill color

With everything combined we get the original plot that is part of the original post.
