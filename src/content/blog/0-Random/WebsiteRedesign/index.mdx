import playground from "./images/gradient_playground.mov";

This site just got a full rebuild, both technically and thematically. It’s faster, more maintainable, and much better aligned with how I want to write, share, and build.

# Why Redesign the Site?

The old site worked fine as a portfolio. It was clean, minimal, and focused on showcasing projects. But as my goals shifted, the format started to feel restrictive.

- The tone was overly formal and tailored for recruiters, not real readers
- I had nowhere to put notes, small writeups, or informal thoughts
- The tech stack was [bloated and annoying to update](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/comments/1hh3v0u/why_developers_love_to_hate_gatsbyjs_but_should/)
- The layout was too rigid to support different content types

So I redesigned it entirely from scratch.

# Rebuilt the Stack

The site is now built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator with zero-JS by default. The new architecture emphasizes performance, modularity, and ease of content authoring.

- **No client-side JS** by default: everything is statically rendered
- **Markdown + content collections**: strongly typed content organization
- **Cleaner file structure**: component logic and layouts are isolated and reusable
- **Fast builds**: optimized for long-term maintainability and speed

# New Content Structure

### `blog/`

Longer-form, technical or well-structured writeups. These follow a more rigorous tone.

### `projects/`

These are the highlights of things I’ve built, but without the fluff.

### `musings/`

This is one the bigger new additions.

Not everything I write needs to be a finished essay. The *Musings* section is a place for half-formed ideas, experiments, personal observations, or lightweight notes. It reflects a shift from trying to “publish” to just writing more openly, a space for thoughts that don't fit anywhere else.

# Updated Tone, Voice, and Feel

This redesign isn’t just about the words on the page, but it’s about how the whole site *feels* to interact with and ensuring the theme it presents for who I am is truer to life.

The old version was rigid and minimal to a fault. It got out of the way, but it also felt flat and a little lifeless. The new version reflects a broader shift in intention: it’s more personal, more expressive, just more fun to interact with, and a much better reflection of my character.

## Visual Language

The site now uses a more modern, expressive design system:

- **Rounded corners**, **soft shadows**, and **intentional whitespace**
- **Typography** with more character and hierarchy
- **Subtle motion** to make the site feel alive and responsive

These choices help create a sense of rhythm and warmth, even on static pages.

# Component Highlights

I want to highlight some particular elements of the site that feel especially refined.

## Code Blocks

Many of my posts rely on conveying the ability to interpret and replicate coding projects I have done, the density of information that can be expressed in a small chunk of code can be overwhelming when you weren't the one who wrote it, so code block clarity is imperative.

This makes code-heavy posts easier to read and more structured to write. With new file names, better highlighting, output lines for expressing code results and an inviting theme.

Under the hood, it’s powered by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) with custom logic for metadata parsing and rendering.

```python output=2 file=test.py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True # [!code highlight]
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# Useful for running matplotlib on high-dpi displays
%config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'
This is an output line!
This is an output line!
```

## Gradient Playground

With the prior framework it was quite hard to integrate this widget that I wrote to enable users to interact with a gradient space and build intuition about gradient descent.

With the new stack, it was a welcome addition to the [gradient descent intro post](/blog/neural-net-gradient-descent#gradient-playground) where readers can now see what I was always hoping to share with the original post.

# What’s Next

Expect more:

- Technical deep dives
- Lightweight `musings/` entries about tools, books, and habits
- Design refinements and layout polish
- Honest writing, even when unfinished

If you've visited the old version, thanks for sticking around. If you're new, welcome.
