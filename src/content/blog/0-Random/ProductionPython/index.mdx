# Introduction

- Quick context for the reader: who this is for, what they’ll get, and why it matters in real-world Python.
- Brief statement of your practical experience or approach.

# Why Tooling Matters in Production

- Linting with Ruff (one or two-sentence benefit)
- Formatting with Black
- Example: How to integrate them (`pyproject.toml` sample, pre-commit mention)

# Managing Dependencies and Environments

- Using uv or pip for dependency management, lockfiles for reproducibility
- Virtual environments, Python version management (pyenv/poetry/pipx mention)
- Simple best practice code/config snippet

# Testing: Your Foundation

- Encouragement to start with pytest, mention fixture & parametrize features
- Code sample: a good, realistic test function w/ meaningful assertion
- Code coverage wisdom (80-90% is realistic)
- How you run tests locally and in CI/CD

# Writing Maintainable, Idiomatic Python

- Use of idioms: unpacking, comprehensions, context managers
- Clarity and readability over “clever” code
- Type hints & how/why to use them (`mypy` reference)
- Sample: a clear, annotated function or dataclass

# Observability: Logging, Monitoring, and Alerts

- Structured logging (structlog/loguru)
- Monitoring recommendations: Sentry, Prometheus, etc.
- Code snippet: structured logging use

# Favorite Python Tricks

- List a few: e.g. walrus operator, `pathlib`, `itertools`, `dataclass.replace`
- A sample code chunk showcasing a trick
