Hey, I'm **Patrick** ðŸ‘‹, welcome!

I enjoy building sustainable solutions to difficult real-world problems, currently a **Simulation Software Engineer II** helping to solve **Autonomy @ Rivian**.

Previously, I completed my Computer Science MS and developed **Simulation Software @ SpaceX** in pursuit of the first private crewed-launches.

In my free time I enjoy writing new blog posts, divulging on spurious topics off my head, and being extra technical about my coffee and baking hobbies.

Something about getting in touch...
