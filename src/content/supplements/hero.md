Hey, I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my home on the web. I enjoy building sustainable solutions to real-world problems, currently helping to solve Autonomy @ Rivian.

Previously, I completed my Computer Science MS and developed Simulation Software @ SpaceX in pursuit of the first private crewed-launches in history.

In my free time I enjoy writing new blog posts, divulging on spurious topics off my head, and being extra technical about my coffee and baking hobbies.
