Hey, Iâ€™m Patrick ðŸ‘‹ I build engineering solutions that are scalable, adaptable, and meaningful â€” creating technology that can make a lasting impact.

I hold a Computer Science MS and have experience developing Simulation Software at SpaceX. Currently, as a Software Engineer II at Rivian, I work on autonomous vehicle systems simulation.
