Hey, Iâ€™m [Patrick](/musings/little-about-me) ðŸ‘‹ I create systems that are intuitive and meaningful, tackling <a href="/PatrickYoussefResume.pdf" target="_blank">real-world challenges</a> along the way.

Currently, Iâ€™m an <a href="https://stories.rivian.com/enhanced-highway-assist-gen2" target="_blank" >Autonomy Software Engineer @ Rivian</a>, building tools to scale simulations and provide insights.

Beyond the screen, Iâ€™m perfecting my coffee, running, or diving into <a class="projects" href="/projects" >projects</a> that <a class="blog" href="/blog" >pique my interest</a> and <a class="musings" href="/musings" >growth</a>.
