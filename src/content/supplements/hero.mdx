Hey, Iâ€™m **Patrick** ðŸ‘‹ I create systems that are intuitive and meaningful, tackling real-world challenges along the way.

Previously, I developed **Simulation Software @ SpaceX**, supporting the first private crewed missions to the ISS.

Currently, Iâ€™m an **Autonomy Software Engineer II @ Rivian**, building tools to scale simulations and provide insights.

Beyond the screen, Iâ€™m perfecting my coffee, running, or **diving into projects** that pique my interest and growth.
