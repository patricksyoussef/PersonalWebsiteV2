I've never claimed to be a poet, but it’s a means of coalescing thoughts into meaningul distillations, albeit sometimes a bit messy. Some will only hold meaning only for me, others might resonate deeply, regardless sharing them feels like part of the point.

<PoemLayout title="Blessed Uncertainty">
    There is a terror in not knowing, a quiet ache when the future folds itself like fog just beyond my reach.

    Yet what a blessing for life to hold so much that even my brightest mind cannot fathom the architecture of what waits for me.

    To be undone by wonder, to be small before the scale of what is forming just out of sight, what grace.

    That alternative is a comfort too clean, a map drawn too early, where every joy is pre-labeled, every path rehearsed, every wild edge tamed into predictability that soothes all oneness from reality.

    What grief that would be, for the mystery to be lost, for the vastness to be flattened into a well-reasoned life that never startled me with its beauty and splendor.

    So let me tremble before the unknown, not as a child afraid of dark corners, but as a soul standing at the edge of something too large to name, and too precious to limit.

    Allow me be terrified, because that means there is more ahead than I could ever ask for life to unveil to me in these times, to my current limited mind.

    And may I never trade the holy chaos of becoming for the dull safety of having it all figured out.

<PoemLayout title="Atlas Boy">
    They deemed him strong, as though strength were the absence of fracture, as though the unrelenting burden he bore was not etching elegies into the curvature of his spine.

    His hands, calloused altars of devotion, raised what would have reduced other to ruin, and still he stood, not in defiance, but in bow: a boy-turned-myth, holding sky aloft so others might not feel its fall.

    They praised his composure, the still gaze, the elegance with which he translated agony into silence, as if serenity were a synonym for salvation, as if his restraint did not carry the stench of sacrifice.

    Yet no ode was written for the nights he wept into the marrow of his mattress, no audience to witness the dialogues he kept with doubt, with exhaustion, with the unbearable inheritance of being needed.

    He bore the grief of others with the grace of a cathedral, holding anguish not as weight, but as purpose, transmuting pain into scaffolding, that others might find shelter in his steadiness.

    He bled metaphor, sweated absolution, tempered resolve like steel in ancestral flame, from a world that mistook his silence for consent.

    And still he rose, not untouched, but unwavering. Not whole, but holy in fracture, a monument to resilience carved not from stone, but from sorrow that refused to sink.

    So when, at last, the question came “How did you endure what should have undone you?” he did not answer with boast or bitterness. He looked upward, past the reach of hands, to the sky he had borne like prayer, and replied with a voice both weary and reverent.

    **“I never permitted myself to forget the heavens I was made to hold”**

<PoemLayout title="Tomorrow Is Not Promised">
    We speak of tomorrow with casual entitlement, as though time were an obedient servant, as though dawn owed us its gold, as though breath were promised by mere precedent.

    Yet what is tomorrow, if not mercy unearned? A delicate indulgence the world may withhold, a silence that may fall before our reply, a page that turns without ink, a story with no end.

    This knowing does not drive me to fear, but to reverence of every bit of grace from life. To lift each cup as if it might be the last, to speak as if the words might outlive me.

    I have spent years stalling inside of someday, postponing joy until clarity condescends to arrive, but I now see, peace was was never waiting for me on the horizon. It was folded, subtly and succinctly, inside this breath, this moment, this unrepeatable fragment of light.

    We delay love for certainty, delay truth for timing, delay rest for the myth of arrival, as if tomorrows were infinite and always generous, a tree of eternal fruit.

    But now I move more slowly, and more whole: with the gravity of someone who has seen the veil, and the grade of one who bows before the ordinary, saying, simply: it is enough.

    And should morning grace my window again, may it find me not yearning, but already living.

<PoemLayout title="Paced Miles">
    I’ve learned that days aren’t races, they’re rivers that find their own way, curling around small stone decisions while I breath, feet firm in the sand.

    I’ve learned to savor morning’s hush: toast warm with butter, warm window light, a run that listens to heartbeat and song instead of numbers on a watch’s face.

    I’ve learned that strength isn’t only barbell iron, sometimes it’s pausing mid-career plans to taste the coffee, call a friend, read a book, or leave a questions un-answered (for now).

    I’ve learned the art of gentle edits, trimming plans and expectations like pruning vines, letting one bright idea flower while others wait their season.

    And more than anything I’ve  learned that patience is motion, not standing still but moving slow: a steady rhythm of work and rest, room for wonder to quietly grow.

    These are the lessons pacing my life, soft footfalls on a shaded trail, steady breath in a widening world, trusting each sunrise to show me the math.

<PoemLayout title="The Slow Return">
    I recall, not without ache, the veil drawn over certainty. The silent erosion of edges, once crisp, reduced to a chiaroscuro of guesswork, as if the world had receded beyond grasp, not in distance, but in trust. And still, time moved onward, indifferent to my agony. Wait.

    The hours, long and coiled, where I sat in negotiation with stillness, for permission to hold my fear without unraveling, as every unanswered questions echoed louder. Wait.

    Healing did not arrive with trumpets, but crept in like tidewater through reeds. Incremental, uncelebrated, a recalibration of self and sense, where the body, in its silent wisdom, began again to remember what facets of life bear beauty in the simplest of beholding. Wait.

    Now, on morning when focus returns, fleeting yet whole, I feel the pull to claim victory, to name the clarity as earned. But I have grown gentler in my wanting, more reverent towards uncertainty, more willing to let light linger before I reach. Wait.

    For this is how restoration reveals itself in chaos, not in thunderclap or sudden grandeur, but through the humble rituals of returning: to the body, to patience, to the ever-shifting present and passing of time. Where knowing and confusion coexist in quiet accord. Wait.
