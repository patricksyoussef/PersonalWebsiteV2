I'm that person who will drive twenty minutes out of the way for good coffee.

This is my running log of coffee spots I've tried. Just notes on what worked and what didn't.

# Stereoscope 🔭

## 📍 Newport Beach, CA · Jul. 31, 2023

![Heavenly Chaos](./images/stereoscope_ceiling.jpg)

**Drink Order:** Iced Madagascar Vanilla Latte

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                           |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★★★  | Good espresso and pour overs. They know what they're doing with single origins. |
| Food     | ★★★★★  | Really good breakfast plate. The jam is excellent.                              |
| Service  | ★★★☆☆  | Can be slow and a bit distant during busy times. Not unfriendly, just detached. |
| Ambience | ★★★★★  | Clean design, nice ceiling detail inside, outdoor patio gets good light.        |
| Vibe     | ★★★★☆  | Modern but comfortable. Mix of brunch crowd and people working.                 |

Every shot is dialed in and the kitchen moves at its own pace. The payoff is clear: layered espresso, pour-over flights where you can taste the differences, and a breakfast plate that overachieves for a café. Come with time to spare and leave both wired and full.

| Vibe     | ★★★★★  | Good mix of modern and cozy. Easy to work here.                      |

Component lives in a converted planing mill: brick, timber, plants, brass. Order the breakfast burrito, open the laptop, and settle in. Staff won’t rush you and the room stays comfortable for a multi-hour work session.

Stell bets on neighborhood comfort over third-wave pageantry. Vanilla lattes, turkey clubs, and the obligatory scoop of pasta salad keep regulars loyal. Staff learn names; customers linger.
