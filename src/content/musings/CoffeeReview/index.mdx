# Stereoscope 🔭

## 📍 Newport Beach, CA · Jul. 31, 2023

![Heavenly Chaos](./images/stereoscope_ceiling.jpg)

**Drink Order:** Iced Madagascar Vanilla Latte

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                              |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★★★  | Dialed-in espresso, excellent pour overs, and standout single origins.             |
| Food     | ★★★★★  | Best-in-class breakfast plate, the jam is insane.                                  |
| Service  | ★★★☆☆  | Can be slow and a bit aloof, especially during peak hours. Not rude, just distant. |
| Ambience | ★★★★★  | Art-gallery-meets-coffee-lab. Dreamy ceiling inside, mellow coastal patio outside. |
| Vibe     | ★★★★☆  | Sleek but not sterile. Slightly LA energy, brunch crowd meets design nerds.        |

Every shot is dialed in and the kitchen moves at its own pace. The payoff is clear: layered espresso, pour-over flights where you can taste the differences, and a breakfast plate that overachieves for a café. Come with time to spare and leave both wired and full.

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                          |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★☆☆  | Balanced and smooth, with a few creative specials worth a try. |
| Food     | ★★★★☆  | More than pastries, good toasts and killer breakfast burritos. |
| Service  | ★★★★★  | Friendly and efficient, with a laid-back vibe.                 |
| Ambiance | ★★★★☆  | Gorgeous warm-toned interior with brick, wood, and plants.     |
| Vibe     | ★★★★★  | A great blend of modern aesthetics and cozy comfort.           |

Component lives in a converted planing mill: brick, timber, plants, brass. Order the breakfast burrito, open the laptop, and settle in. Staff won’t rush you and the room stays comfortable for a multi-hour work session.

# Stell Coffee and Tea 🍵

## 📍 Redlands, CA · Nov. 18, 2022

![Pasta Salad Supremacy](./images/stells.jpg)

**Drink Order:** Iced Vanilla Latte (Half-Sweet)

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                              |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★☆☆  | Classic coffeehouse fare. Reliable, but don’t expect nuance or single origins.     |
| Food     | ★★★★☆  | Sandwiches are comforting and fresh, pasta salad is a nostalgic bonus.             |
| Service  | ★★★★☆  | Counter-style and friendly. Staff keep things moving and treat regulars well.      |
| Ambience | ★★★☆☆  | Indoor leans casual, outdoor with a patio that catches great sunlight.             |
| Vibe     | ★★★★☆  | A community staple; low-key, unfussy, and a little bit old-school in the best way. |

Stell bets on neighborhood comfort over third-wave pageantry. Vanilla lattes, turkey clubs, and the obligatory scoop of pasta salad keep regulars loyal. Staff learn names; customers linger.

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                           |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★★☆  | Classic, reliable, and simple.                                                  |
| Food     | ★★★☆☆  | Simple but solid. Expect pastries and light bites, not full meals.              |
| Service  | ★★★☆☆  | Warm but (very) low-key. They keep the space calm and well-run.                 |
| Ambience | ★★★★☆  | Design-forward and peaceful. Natural light, curated furniture, and cozy corners |
| Vibe     | ★★★★★  | Intentional and calming, a break from the chaos of Broadway St                  |

Anecdote keeps everything quiet—light jazz, soft voices, big windows. Nurse a flat white for an hour while sunlight crawls across vintage tables. Perfect for disappearing into a book or sketchpad.

# Farine Bakery & Cafe 🥐

## 📍 Redmond, WA · Mar. 18, 2023

![Never Too Many Croissants](./images/farine.jpg)

**Drink Order:** Hot Vanilla Latte (Half-Sweet)

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★★☆  | Solid espresso and smooth milk drinks, but the coffee is more of a co-star to the food. |
| Food     | ★★★★★  | Legit bakery. Croissants, mille-feuille, hearty tartines, they're the real standout.    |
| Service  | ★★★★☆  | Efficient and super inviting despite the crowd, a welcome intro to Washington           |
| Ambience | ★★★★★  | Tall ceilings, natural light, industrial fixtures. It’s visually striking but not cold. |
| Vibe     | ★★★★★  | Lively and social. Lots of families enjoying themselves and friends catching up.        |

Block out the morning. Start with a tartine, add a second croissant when the tray reappears, and watch skylight patterns slide across the tables. Time evaporates here.

# Captain + Stoker 🚲

## 📍 Monterey, CA · Oct. 2, 2023

![The Lineup](./images/stoker.jpg)

**Drink Order:** Hot Flat White

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                                |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Drink    | ★★★☆☆  | Nice presentation, but the brews themselves are often a little underdeveloped.       |
| Food     | ★★★☆☆  | Small, simple menu with some light toast-and-salad combos—fine, but not memorable.   |
| Service  | ★★★★☆  | Staff are upbeat and helpful, though things can run a little loose.                  |
| Ambience | ★★★★★  | Breezy, bright, huge garage doors, coastal sun, and bike shop charm.                 |
| Vibe     | ★★★★★  | Playful, relaxed, and deeply local. It’s a community spot first, coffee shop second. |

Captain + Stoker runs on coastal inertia: garage doors up, bikes stacked outside, ocean air rolling through. Espresso is fine and unfussy; the laid-back scene is the real draw.

# Coffee @ Home 🏡

## 📍 City in CA? · All Day Every Day

**Drink Order:** Anything and Everything

| Category | Rating | Notes                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drink    | ★★★★★  | Dialed to your taste, made with care, and not a single burnt shot in sight.             |
| Food     | ★★★★☆  | Depends on the day, but strong odds of something nutrient-dense and secretly optimized. |
| Service  | ★★★★★  | Responsive, intuitive, and occasionally shirtless. Always knows your order.             |
| Ambience | ★★★★★  | Counter space squared off with precision. Light hits the matcha just right.             |
| Vibe     | ★★★★★  | Quiet, focused, and entirely yours. Best seat is always open.                           |

The home bar is the control group: beans you picked, water you trust, and exactly the milk texture you like. No line, no tip jar, just predictable excellence under familiar light.
