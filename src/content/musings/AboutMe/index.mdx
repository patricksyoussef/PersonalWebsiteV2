# *"I question the little things so big things fall into place"*

Hey there, I'm Patrick. Since you've made it this far into my website, welcome to my little corner of curiosity and chaos. At Rivian, I work on autonomy systems, crafting tools and metrics that help self-driving technology learn, improve, and inspire what's possible.

Beyond the ML engineering and metrics pipelines, I'm really just a guy asking "why" at every turn: Why does code work better when broken into tiny, logical bits? Why does coffee hit just right at 201°F? Why can sliding my desk an inch to the left unlock a whole morning of focus?

Some mornings you'll catch me running trails before sunrise, breathing in the quiet. Other times I'm figuring out the perfect matcha latte, or rearranging my apartment for the umpteenth time, hunting down that sweet spot between form and function.

I mentor because I remember what it was like to be stuck, staring at a bug for hours; I write because ideas only become real when they land on the page; and I experiment, because that's where magic hides between intention and reality, where ideas become more than just that.

For me, engineering is about stewardship: building things people trust, respect, and actually want to use. Whether I’m designing an API, debugging a Monte Carlo simulation, or adjusting tiny UX details, I’m after simplicity and clarity, not complexity. I enjoy seeing someone use something I built without hitting roadblocks, and I value the messy, behind-the-scenes work that makes that possible.

If any of this resonates, if you're also the sort of person who notices the small stuff, who savors nuance, and who digs into the "why" instead of just the "how," let's chat. Maybe we'll build something together, stir up a little mischief, or simply share what makes us tick.

Whatever it is, I’m glad you’re here.
