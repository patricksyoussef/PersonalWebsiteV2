Hey there, I'm Patrick. I notice when things are slightly off and can't resist figuring out why.

My work has taken me from rocket simulations at SpaceX to self-driving systems at Rivian. Different domains, same approach: building systems that actually work and thinking about how the pieces fit together rather than just optimizing in isolation.

I write and teach because I remember being stuck on problems for hours, and I like helping people skip that confusion. When something finally clicks for me, putting it into words helps me understand it better and hopefully saves someone else the struggle.

I spend probably too much time on projects that seem unnecessary to other people. Custom syntax highlighting for this website when good solutions already existed. Rearranging furniture until something feels right. Reading philosophy and engaging edges of my brain because wrestling with big questions somehow sharpens my thinking on smaller ones.

I'm suspicious of "good enough." The interesting stuff usually happens when you keep pushing past the point where most people would stop. Most problems are hiding in plain sight, disguised as things that are "just how it is."

If any of this resonates, if you're also the sort of person who notices the small stuff and digs into the "why" instead of just "how," I'm glad you're here. Feel free to explore the posts, or reach out if you want to chat about any of it.
