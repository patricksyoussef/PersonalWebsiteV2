I’m Patrick. My work has taken me from rocket simulations at SpaceX to self-driving systems at Rivian. Different domains, same approach: building systems that actually work and thinking about how the pieces fit together instead of just optimizing in isolation.

I write and teach because I remember being stuck on problems for hours and hours. When something finally clicks, putting it into words sharpens my own understanding. Hopefully it also spares someone else the same confusion but sparks the same joy.

I spend (maybe) too much time on projects most would call unnecessary. Custom code blocks for this website when solid solutions exist. Rearranging layouts until the flow feels right. Reading philosophy because wrestling with big questions clarifies my thinking on small ones.

“Good enough” rarely feels like enough. The most interesting discoveries usually appear just beyond the point where most people stop, exploration merits its own worth.

If any of this resonates, if you also notice the small stuff and keep asking why instead of just how, I’m glad you’re here and I hope you enjoy what you find.
