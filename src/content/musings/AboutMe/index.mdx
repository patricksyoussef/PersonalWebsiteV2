# *"I question the tiny things so big things fall into place"*

Hey there, I’m Patrick, and if you’ve made it this far, welcome to my little corner of curiosity and chaos. By day, I’m elbow‑deep in self‑driving simulations at Rivian, quietly shaping tools and metrics that help autonomous systems learn and improve.

But beyond the dashboards and data pipelines, I’m really just a human asking “why” at every turn: why does code read better broken into tiny, logical bits? Why does coffee hit just right at 201°F? Why does sliding my desk an inch to the left unlock a whole morning of focus?

Some mornings you’ll catch me running trails before sunrise, breathing in the quiet. Other afternoons you might find me obsessing over the perfect matcha latte, or perusing my apartment layout for the umpteenth time, hunting down that sweet spot between form and function.

I mentor because I remember what it was like to be stuck, staring at a bug for hours; I write because ideas only become real when they land on the page; and I experiment, always, because that’s where magic hides between intention and reality and ideas become more than just that.

I believe that engineering is an act of stewardship: a way to build things people trust, respect, and actually want to use. Whether I’m crafting an API, debugging a Monte Carlo simulation, or tweaking the tiniest UX detail, I’m chasing clarity, not cleverness. There’s joy in watching someone glide through a problem because of something I quietly thought through, and there’s equal joy in the messy, unpolished moments that no one ever sees.

If any of this resonates, if you’re also the sort of person who notices the small stuff, who savors nuance, and who digs into the “why” instead of just the “how”, let’s chat. Maybe we’ll build something together, stir up a little mischief, or simply share what makes us tick.

Whatever it is, I’m glad you’re here.
